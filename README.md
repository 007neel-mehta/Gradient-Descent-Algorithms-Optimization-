# Gradient-Descent-Algorithms-Optimization-

Applying grading descent algorithms to find the optimum value of the given functions using different variant of this algorithms based on the problem. The goal is to find the best learning rate for the algorithm which convereges the solution in the least number of steps possible. 

There are different variants of the algorithm in this folder.You can choose any one folder there you will find the problem in a pdf file which has many exercises in order. In this same folder you can find the code to solve that in Python (ipynb files).

Thanks
